## Title Slide

The Community College Consortium for OER proclaims that "Open education is an attitude, a practice, and a method of teaching that inspires inquiry, equal access to course materials, and sharing lessons and materials with the wider community. At the center of open education is the belief that education is strengthened when shared openly. Open education relies on OER and open licensing."  

Here at Whatcom Community College we've seen OER evolve from grant developed one-time resources to a growing culture of curating, sharing and updating materials.

## Slide 2 PressBooks

One way that we've built this culture was through the deliberate and purposeful use of open source software so that the work we do can also be as technically open and interoperatible as possible.  

Despite our size as a small (2500 FTE) rural college we've been able to leverage the collective power of this large community driven open software projects to be the backbone of our OER infrastructure. This is important because...

Pressbooks is a Multisite WordPress install with a book pubication overlay.

## Slide 3 Anthologies

The first OER Textbook that was piloted was a Sci-Fi and Fantasy Anthology that came about due to challenges the Faculty instructor had in locating exisiting anthologies that adequately reflected the diversity of writers in these genres. 

During this collaboration process, licensed library resources (such as entire short stories and scholarly material) were added to provide additional pedagogical resources for the literature students. 

From this pilot our Pressbooks install grew via demand from our cybersecuirty and health sciences programs as well as political sciences and naturally, our 200 level library research class.
