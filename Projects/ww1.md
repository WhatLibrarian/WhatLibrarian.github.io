# Enhancing Student Success Through the Use of OER

## Welcome/Intro/L.O./Paperwork Reqs for Adjuncts

## Summary: Intro to "Open" and some tools

### FEW Learning Outcomes
At the end of this Faculty Educational Workshop, participants will be able to:
- Properly identify the Creative Commons (CC) license on a resource.
- Effectively search for open resources and post review in an OER repository
- Create an open resource by remixing multiple existing resources and designate a license to this new resource.
- Understand accessibility in the realm of Open

# Week 1
## Intro to Open, Why Open?

**Keywords:** Open Access, Academic Libraries, Publishing, Creative Commons

### Module 1 Learning Objectives
- Understand Open
- Ingest the 5 R's of Open
- Begin deciding on OER FEW Project

#### Why are we here? Value Proposition
"a site of praxis, a place where theories about learning, teaching, technology, and social justice enter into a conversation with each other and inform the development of educational practices and structures."
- Robin DeRosa and Rajiv Jhangiani  ["ideas for implementing or experimenting with open pedagogy."](http://openpedagogy.org/open-pedagogy/) In the "What is Open Pedagogy" section.

Introduce the concept of “Open” and discuss the concept of Open as it applies more broadly to research, technology, government, art and education.

# Final Project Options (non-exclusive)

Sharing supports the idea that the majority of learning occurs outside the classroom "and reinforces, in both theory and practice, the notion of overgreen learning beyound formal sites of education." Building a Culture of Open Pedagogy by City Tech.

## Adopt or Adapt ([Pressbooks](http://textbooks.whatcom.edu) or Canvas)

Share to Canvas Commons and OER Commons.
If publisher has intake form, submission on form (stewardship)

## Create (H5P or Pressbooks)
Reusable pieces in H5P (anciliary, auxiliary).  Share to Commons, tie to original resource.

## Engage (Reading Annotations via Hypothesis)
- Reading Apprenticeships
- Scholarly Conversations
[Hypothesis Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCkm0lL-6lc) A little *starry eyed* but gets to an importance.  

Yes, you can group annotate in Canvas, but this will allow students to learn annotation skills and give them an introduction to an open scholarly communication tool that they can use in their professional lives.

Example Uses in the classroom

Hypothesis can used in an education context to collaboratively annotate course readings and other internet resources.  Below is a list created by Hypothes.is providing ten suggestions on how the tools could be used in the classroom:

    Teacher Annotations
    Pre-populate a text with questions fro students to reply to in annotations or notes elucidating important points as they read.
    Annotation as Gloss
    Have students look up difficult words or unknown words or unknown allusions in a text and share their research as annotations.
    Annotations as Question
    Have students highlight, tag and annotate words or passages that are confusing to them in their readings.
    Annotation as Close Reading
    Have students identify formal textual elements and broader social and historical contexts at work in specific passages.
    Annotation as Rhetorical Analysis
    Have students mark and explain the use of rhetorical strategies in online articles or essays.
    Annotation as Opinion
    Have students share their personal opinions on a controversial topic as discussed by an article.
    Annotation as Multimedia Writing
    Have students annotate with images or integrate images and video into other types of annotations.
    Annotations as Independent Study
    Have students explore the Internet on thier own with some limited direction (find an article from a respectable source on a topic important to you personally), exercising literacy skills (define difficult words, identify persuasive strategies etc.)
    Annotation as Annotated Bibliography
    Have students research a topic and tag and annotate relevant texts across the Internet.
    Annotations as Creative Act
    Have students respond creatively to their reading with their own poetry, prose or visual art as annotations.
