# Week 1  Introduction to Open, Why Open?

**Keywords:** Open Access, Academic Libraries, Publishing, Creative Commons

## Land Acknowledgement
"We acknowledge that this land is the traditional teritory of the Lummi and Nooksack Peooples. Their presence is imbued in these mountains, valleys, waterways, and shorelines. May we nurture our relationship with our Coast Salish neighbors, and the shared responsibilities to their homeland where we all reside today."

## Value Proposition: Why are we here? 
Intent of this FEW is that we are in "...a site of praxis, a place where theories about learning, teaching, technology, and social justice enter into a conversation with each other and inform the development of educational practices and structures."
(Robin DeRosa and Rajiv Jhangiani  ["ideas for implementing or experimenting with open pedagogy."](http://openpedagogy.org/open-pedagogy/) In the "What is Open Pedagogy" section.)

### Defining the "Open" in Open Content and Open Educational Resources

The terms "open content" and "open educational resources" describe any copyrightable work that is either (1) in the public domain or (2) licensed in a manner that provides users with free and perpetual permission to engage in the 5R activities:

- Retain - the right to make, own, and control copies of the content (e.g., download, duplicate, store, and manage)
- Reuse - the right to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a video)
- Revise - the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (e.g., translate the content into another language)
- Remix - the right to combine the original or revised content with other material to create something new (e.g., incorporate the content into a mashup)
- Redistribute - the right to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (e.g., give a copy of the content to a friend)

## Introduction to Open Educational Resources (OER)

The following video offers a very brief introduction to OER. 

 
### What is OER?

Open educational resources are educational materials and resources offered freely and openly for anyone and available under a license that allows users to use, remix, improve and redistribute. Sharing ideas and resources and collaborating on projects as part of a community is key to the Open Education movement.

 
### What can you do with OER?

Teachers bring OER to life. Open educational resources are innovative not just because they are free, but because of how teachers adopt and creatively adapt them, bringing them to life in the classroom in order to reach every student.

- Retain - the right to make, own, and control copies of the content (e.g., download, duplicate, store, and manage)
- Reuse - the right to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a video)
- Revise - the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (e.g., translate the content into another language)
- Remix - the right to combine the original or revised content with other material to create something new (e.g., incorporate the content into a mashup)
- Redistribute - the right to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (e.g., give a copy of the content to a friend)

### What are the benefits of creating and using Open Educational Resources?

#### OER offer financial and pedagogical benefits. 

- improving student performance and satisfaction
- increasing access to educational materials for a wider range of learners, including those underserved by traditional educational opportunities
- giving instructors the flexibility to customize materials specifically for their students' needs
- encouraging educators to engage in critical reflection of educational resources
- helping students, districts, and educational institutions save money


Learn more about current research on the impact of OER at the [OER Research Hub website](http://oerhub.net/) 

 
### OER is any material with an open license used for teaching or learning

That means activities, curriculum, lesson or unit plans, professional development, textbooks, stories, tools, videos, wiki, full courses, podcasts, a syllabus... and more!



### Activity Questions to Consider

1. What do you like about your current textbook? What are the necessities for your students? In other words, what can you not give up? 
2. What do you dislike about your current textbook? List everything that you do not like. Let’s assume that if you came to hear about open textbooks and other OER that you do not like the cost of a textbook. What else?

# Final Project Options (non-exclusive)

Sharing supports the idea that the majority of learning occurs outside the classroom "and reinforces, in both theory and practice, the notion of overgreen learning beyound formal sites of education." Building a Culture of Open Pedagogy by City Tech.

## Adopt or Adapt ([Pressbooks](http://textbooks.whatcom.edu) or Canvas)

* Share to Canvas Commons and OER Commons.
* If publisher has intake form, submission on form (stewardship)

[Resources](https://libguides.uta.edu/oer/creation)
[Resources](https://cccoer.org/learn/select-oer)

## Create (Learning Objects with [H5P](https://h5p.org))
Reusable pieces in H5P (anciliary, auxiliary).  Share to Commons, tie to original resource
* Student will not need to install any software to use the learning object.
* Sharing is easy
* Most content types are WCAG 2.0 AA

* Share to Canvas Commons and OER Commons

## Engage (Reading Annotations via [Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/))
- Reading Apprenticeships
- Scholarly Conversations
### Video 
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/QCkm0lL-6lc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCkm0lL-6lc) A little *starry eyed* but gets to an importance.  

Yes, you can group annotate in Canvas, but this will allow students to learn annotation skills and give them an introduction to an open scholarly communication tool that they can use in their professional lives.

Example Uses in the classroom

Hypothesis can used in an education context to collaboratively annotate course readings and other internet resources.  Below is a list created by Hypothes.is providing ten suggestions on how the tools could be used in the classroom:

* Teacher Annotations
 * Pre-populate a text with questions fro students to reply to in annotations or notes elucidating important points as they read.
* Annotation as Gloss
 * Have students look up difficult words or unknown words or unknown allusions in a text and share their research as annotations.
* Annotations as Question
 * Have students highlight, tag and annotate words or passages that are confusing to them in their readings.
- Annotation as Close Reading
 - Have students identify formal textual elements and broader social and historical contexts at work in specific passages.
- Annotation as Rhetorical Analysis
 - Have students mark and explain the use of rhetorical strategies in online articles or essays.
- Annotation as Opinion
 - Have students share their personal opinions on a controversial topic as discussed by an article.
- Annotation as Multimedia Writing
 - Have students annotate with images or integrate images and video into other types of annotations.
- Annotations as Independent Study
 - Have students explore the Internet on thier own with some limited direction (find an article from a respectable source on a topic important to you personally), exercising literacy skills (define difficult words, identify persuasive strategies etc.)
- Annotation as Annotated Bibliography
 -  Have students research a topic and tag and annotate relevant texts across the Internet.
- Annotations as Creative Act
 - Have students respond creatively to their reading with their own poetry, prose or visual art as annotations.
