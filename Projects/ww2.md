Myths about Copyright 
(original by Brad Templeton) 
•	Copying just a little bit is OK. 
•	Attribution is as good as permission.
•	It's free advertising. 
•	I modified it; now it's mine. 
•	It's OK--it's for educational purposes.
•	You have to give away all your rights to get published. 
•	It doesn't say it's copyrighted.
•	It's on the Web so I can use it without asking.



The distinction between what is fair use and what is infringement in a particular case will not always be clear or easily defined. There is no specific number of words, lines, or notes that may safely be taken without permission. Acknowledging the source of the copyrighted material does not substitute for obtaining permission,

“Use fairly. Not too much. Have reasons.”
