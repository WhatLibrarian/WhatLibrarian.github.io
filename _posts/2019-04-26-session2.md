## What is the Public Domain?

This chart is a tool that I use sometimes, its very complex and I would never expect anyone else to use it: [Hirtle Chart](https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain)  

**Being out of print does not make it "public domain".**

### Federal Documents are OER.  They are free from any copyright.

# Fair Use

This paper "[Economic impact of Fair Use](https://www.ccianet.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Fair-Use-in-the-U.S.-Economy-2017.pdf)" is a good demonstration of the economic power of Fair Use.

## Example from art:
Nina Paley is a Jewish American cartoonist and animator. To see the artist’s explanation of this work and a guide to each of the characters, [visit her blog](http://blog.ninapaley.com/2012/10/01/this-land-is-mine/). This work is from 2012 and is sung by Andy Williams (originally composed by Ernest Gold as the theme for the movie, Exodus, with the lyrics added later by Pat Boone).

"[_Sita Sings the Blues_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzTg7YXuy34) is a 2008 American animated musical romantic comedy-drama film written, directed, produced and animated by American artist Nina Paley. It intersperses events from the Ramayana, light-hearted but knowledgeable discussion of historical background by a trio of Indian shadow puppets, musical interludes voiced with tracks by Annette Hanshaw and scenes from the artist's own life. The ancient mythological and modern biographical plot are parallel tales, sharing numerous themes." [Text from Wikipedia CC-BY-SA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sita_Sings_the_Blues)

## General Fair Use Tips

- “again today we have a federal court making it clear that fair use is not just a carve-out of the copyright system but a right on the same level of those described in the rest of the statute”
- **“Use fairly. Not too much. Have reasons.”**
- **Always question:** What is the pedagogical purpose of this item? How will it be used?

The distinction between what is fair use and what is infringement in a particular case will not always be clear or easily defined. There is no specific number of words, lines, or notes that may safely be taken without permission. Acknowledging the source of the copyrighted material does not substitute for obtaining permission.

Fair use provisions of the copyright law allow use of copyrighted materials on a limited basis for specific purposes without requiring the permission of the copyright holder. Below we will detail the current state of the law, including the four factors, transformative uses, and cases for reference.

**Apply fair use prudently, and manage risk sensibly.**
**“Use fairly. Not to much. Have reasons.”**
**Ask yourself: What is the pedagogical purpose of this item? How will it be used?**
