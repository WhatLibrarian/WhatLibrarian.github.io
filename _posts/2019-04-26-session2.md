- It's free advertising.
- I modified it; now it's mine.
- It's OK--it's for educational purposes.
- You have to give away all your rights to get published.
- It doesn't say it's copyrighted.

Nina Paley is a Jewish American cartoonist and animator. To see the artist’s explanation of this work and a guide to each of the characters, visit her blog. This work is from 2012 and is sung by Andy Williams (originally composed by Ernest Gold as the theme for the movie, Exodus, with the lyrics added later by Pat Boone).

"Sita Sings the Blues is a 2008 American animated musical romantic comedy-drama film written, directed, produced and animated by American artist Nina Paley. It intersperses events from the Ramayana, light-hearted but knowledgeable discussion of historical background by a trio of Indian shadow puppets, musical interludes voiced with tracks by Annette Hanshaw and scenes from the artist's own life. The ancient mythological and modern biographical plot are parallel tales, sharing numerous themes." [Text from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sita_Sings_the_Blues)


“again today we have a federal court making it clear that fair use is not just a carve-out of the copyright system but a right on the same level of those described in the rest of the statute”

## “Use fairly. Not too much. Have reasons.”
**Always question:** What is the pedagogical purpose of this item? How will it be used?

The distinction between what is fair use and what is infringement in a particular case will not always be clear or easily defined. There is no specific number of words, lines, or notes that may safely be taken without permission. Acknowledging the source of the copyrighted material does not substitute for obtaining permission,

# Handout: Harvard's THE OFFICE FOR SCHOLARLY COMMUNICATION PRESENTS: FAIR USE

*Inspired by the Harvard Office of General Counsel's ["Copyright and Fair Use: A Guide for the Harvard Community](http://ogc.harvard.edu/pages/copyright-and-fair-use)*

Fair use provisions of the copyright law allow use of copyrighted materials on a limited basis for specific purposes without requiring the permission of the copyright holder. Below we will detail the current state of the law, including the four factors, transformative uses, and cases for reference.
___

## INTRODUCTION: WHAT IS FAIR USE?

Fair use is an exception to copyright. One of the most famous, yet the least clear, of all the copyright limitations in the Copyright Act, is the doctrine of fair use. Under fair use, you may use copyrighted material without permission. The doctrine itself was rooted in both English and U.S. caselaw, but was eventually codified in the Copyright Act. The source of fair use law is statutory: Section 107 of the Copyright Act provides for fair use of a work for purposes such as:
- criticism and commentary,
- teaching, scholarship, and research,
- news reporting,

### TRANSFORMATIVE FAIR USE: DEVELOPING LAW

What is a transformative use?

"A work is transformative if, in the words of the Supreme Court, it "adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning or message." Quote from Justice Souter in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 (1994). The full case is available at http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/92-1292.ZO.html

Courts occasionally boil down the 4 fair use factors to 2 questions:

- Does the use transform the material, by using it for a different purpose?
- Was the amount taken appropriate to the new purpose?

5. FURTHER EXPLANATION: QUESTION #1, transforming the material for a different purpose

Including Grateful Dead posters in a book on the illustrated history of the band without permission of the artists was found to be a transformative fair use:

"The images placed in chronological order on a timeline is transformatively different from the mere expressive use of images on concert posters." Quote from Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd., 448 F.3d 605 (2d Cir. 2006). [Full case [pdf]](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/Bill_Graham_case.pdf).

Poster's original purpose: concert promotion, ticket sales, and artistic expression. Poster's new purpose: transformative, educational, scholarly use on a timeline representing the history of a music subculture.

Transformative uses are defined "in context". The use of the copyrighted material must be necessary to the use. Aesthetic, artistic, or "window dressing" uses are NOT transformative uses. For example, use of copyrighted material (such as a quotation, image, video clip, or music clip) may be transformative if:

- Subject to Scholarly Analysis and Critique: The copyrighted material is the subject of the author's or instructor's analysis, clearly critiquing or explaining the material in depth.
- Illustrating an Important Point: The copyrighted material illustrates a compelling point or makes it more comprehensible in a written paper or presentation.
- Re-Purposed for a Significant Teaching Point: The copyrighted material is being re-purposed to significantly advance the author's pedagogical point.

6. FURTHER EXPLANATION: QUESTION 2, was the amount taken appropriate to the new purpose?

The extent of permissible copying varies with the transformative purpose of the use. Sometimes it is necessary to copy entire works; however, only use what is absolutely necessary.

Use of copyrighted images displayed on web sites by the operator of a visual search engine, which displayed search results as "thumbnail" pictures, was "fair use" of copyrighted images. See Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp., 336 F.3d 811 (9th Cir. 2003).  [Full case](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13767420941977220880&q=336+F.3d+811&hl=en&as_sdt=2002).

Use no more than you reasonably need to make your point. It should be readily apparent how the portion you have taken supports the point you are making. If you can reasonably make your point with less of the third-party material, you should use less.

To aid a fair use, use only smaller or shorter portions of the copyrighted material. The smaller the portion of the third-party work you use, the stronger your fair use analysis. While it may be necessary to use the entire work to make your point (see above), and courts have upheld use of the entirety of copyrighted materials in appropriate circumstances, the use of smaller or lower-resolution images aids a finding of fair use.

7. FINAL THOUGHTS

Fair use is ultimately a balancing test.

- To determine whether a use is or is not a fair use, always keep in mind that you must weigh all four factors, and apply the transformative fair use questions.
- You must evaluate each use of copyrighted material individually.  Not all uses will be fair, but the system is designed to allow a great deal of flexibilty for new uses of copyrighted material.
- Only include copyrighted material where there is a reasonable fair use basis.

Apply fair use prudently, and manage risk sensibly.
